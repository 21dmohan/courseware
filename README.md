Courseware for Engineering Software as a Service
================================================

a/k/a UC Berkeley CS (W)169(A,L) Software Engineering, a/k/a CS 169.(1,2,3)x on
EdX

This repo contains information useful to instructors (and arguably
students) using the [ESaaS](http://www.saasbook.info) course materials, including the following:
* `discussions`: Worksheets providing hands-on coding and problem solving exercises.
* `practice-exams`: Review slides and practice exams for midterms and finals.
* `self-checks`: Questions per module for students to verify their understanding.

The recommended setup is to [use Codio](https://codio.saasbook.info) for programming assignments and autograding; the [book's website](http://www.saasbook.info/instructors) has other options.  We no longer support Cloud9 or prebuilt VM images.

The Wiki also contains information on each of the autogradable homeworks,
which are public repos named `saasbook/hw-*`.  (The corresponding
private `saasbook/hw-*-ci` repos contain the autograder files and
reference solutions for each homework.)  The `-ci` repos are generally
off limits except to [registered SaaS instructors](https://www.saasbook.info/instructors).
