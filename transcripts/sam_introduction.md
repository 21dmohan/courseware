Hello there and let me add my welcome to Agile Development using Ruby on Rails.

I just want to say thanks to Dave and Armando for making all of this available. 

They've put so much hard work into it.

We really appreciate what they've made possible here.

Yes, but here we are, its week zero. 

Hopefully you've already completed the background steps in week minus one. 

We're here, the course is still just, sort of, building up. 

We've got a few more resources for you this week. 

If you haven't used edX much before, do checkout the edX demo course. 

We've also got some reviews and refresher material related to version control, bash commands, git immersion and so on. 

These are all things that students have had trouble with in the past.

Also we've got the second half of Ruby on Codecademy.
 
Previous versions of the course have made it clear that these are all areas that students need to brush up on, in order to get the best out of the rest of the course. 

Also, do check out the syllabus we've got full details of everything that's going on. 

You've got the five programming assignments which are the critical components really, all the programming. 

I'd say that's the most important part of the course really. 

And you are going to have to at least *try* pair programming in order to pass the course.  More details on that next week.

We've got a few quizzes, the lowest scoring quiz being dropped. 

65% to get a certificate. 

Yeah lots going on. 

Do check out the whole syllabus there, full details of when the different parts of the course are going to be released. 

So I think we've just about covered the week zero materials. 

We've also got some forms, after the videos, where we ask you for consent, to use the data that we collect from you - anonymized and de-identified, of course. 

If you are happy to let us use your anonymized data for research, to improve this course we'd love to have your consent for that. 

So a couple of new things we have are proctored exams for those wanting to get official academic credit for this course; those are not required unless you are signed up with Charter Oak for official academic credit.

Also we're going to have a part 3 projects course for which you need to complete both the basic and advanced courses and will be on an invitation basis.

We've increased the requirements for pair programming because one, pair programming is great for learning and it's important for you to try it.  

It's also critical for improving team and communication skills.  

What we're really looking for is to see from your pair programming efforts, which of you can demonstrate the programming skills, the people skills, and the committment to succeed in the part 3 team projects course.

That course will involve working with a distributed agile project team with real charity projects, so it's not something you can just drop out of half way through.

So other thing just to draw your attention to is, another thing you need to do is get set up with a coding environment for working with the software in the course. 


We've got a link through here to the text book, of which I am the editor and what a very good book it's becoming. 

Ooh ooh of course it was already a good book in the beginning! 

Definitely worth having the book, not required for the course. 

But what you will want to do is, you want to get setup with the software for the course.

Do check out the student section, where you'll see we've got links to various resources in there

We've also got these Virtual Machine or VM instructions and we are now going with Cloud9 as really the way to go forward.

They've really come on as a hosting service there. 

I've got here my saasbook-ruby Cloud9 workspace.

We've now done all aspects of the entire textbook and the course on Cloud9 and it all works fine and I'm personally very impressed with their service. 

You do need to have a reasonably fast internet connection but I strongly recommend going with Cloud9. 

We've still got some information about some of the other ways that you can get setup with the course software

However I think you will generally find Cloud9 is the path of least resistance. 

But if you are adventurous, do feel free to try out some of the alternatives like Amazon EC2.

We've also got lots and lots of Teaching Assistants. 

We've had over 150 students go through our TA training course, the AV102 and you'll see them active in the discussion forum, which you can find here through this link. 

So do say hello to the TAs there. 

Really appreciate the great hard work from the TAs, who are all volunteers helping you, with your learning process.
 
Yes, we've also got a live chat which is just available in this this one-page here and so you can see a chat going on. 

So if you're in the discussion forum and you aren't able to necessarily completely articulate or maybe you're not
getting exactly want you want, then do also try out the realtime chat.
 
Different people, have different preferences about whether they want to be chatting in real time, or whether they want to be posting to a forum. 

Feel free to use both of those, we've got Teaching Assistants monitoring both those forums - both the chat and the
discussion forum. 

All to help you get the best experience you possibly can out of the course. 

Yeah, once again thanks so much to everybody who puts in a volunteer effort in the course. 

We do also have certificates now for those TAs. 

Do check out, well just ask any of the TAs about the AV102, that's the Agile Ventures course for training TAs and I'm sure you'll get lots of feedback there. 

We've also got the Wiki. 

The Wiki now starts afresh with every course in order to keep it up to daate.

Anybody can edit any of these pages. 

So you can use this as a space to collect additional resources and we'll make sure that they also get passed on into other parts of the course. 

You can see your progress here. 

What I would say is you know, don't suffer in silence.

If you get stuck on anything at all you know, have a go - 20 minutes I think, is a good rule for trying to get
something to work. 

But then post on our discussion forum, the chat, and there's other great forums online like Stack Overflow and so on.

Do do do ask for help! 

And do have great fun in the course and I'm looking forward to speaking to you again next week about the, more of the structure of the course and how the Pair Programming works. 

Alright. Bye for now.
