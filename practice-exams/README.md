## Exams
This directory is a collection of all exam preparation material for CS 169. Previous iterations of CS 169 typically have two examinations, usually named "Midterm 1" and "Midterm 2". The prefix of files in this folder (i.e. `mt1`, `mt2`) refer to which exam the preparation material is geared towards.

*Disclaimer*: These practice exams have been made public at UC Berkeley previously. We advise against using these practice tests as graded exams. If you'd like to proceed using these on actual test, please exercise caution. Since this repository is public, it may be accessible by students.
