	choice_answer do
		text "Which statement best describes how pair programming should be done?"
		answer "Driver and observer should choose roles and stick to them throughout one pairing session"
		distractor "The driver works on task at hand, the observer comments and thinks about next tasks"
		distractor "Promiscuous pairing is valuable because it will alleviate the shortage of programmers"
		explanation "Itâ€™s important that both participants are exposed to both roles, and therefore, get to understand the code from both angles. Relegating duties entirely to one person is less conducive to helping programmers develop a comprehensive understanding of the code."
