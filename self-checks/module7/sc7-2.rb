quiz "7.2: SMART User Stories" do
	choice_answer do
		text "Which Rottenpotatoes feature below is least smart?"
		answer "Given I have a free movie pass, I want to redeem it for an eligible movie before it expires"
		distractor "As a user, I want to search for a movie by title"
		distractor "When adding a movie, 99% of Add Movie pages should appear within 3 seconds"
		distractor "As a customer, I want to see the top 10 movies sold, listed by price, so that I can buy the cheapest one first."
		explanation "Any of the answers are potentially defensible as not living up to the SMART requirements. The reason the given answer was selected is because it doesn’t clarify what “eligible” actually means, and is not specific in general. However, all these stories have room for improvement. We leave it up to you to think about what those improvements might be?"
