quiz "9.5: Metrics, Code Smells, and SOFA" do
	choice_answer do
		text "Which is generally FALSE about code smells?"
		answer "More code is bad; less code is good"
		distractor "They can occur both within a class and in interactions among classes"
		distractor "They may indicate correctness problems"
		distractor "They do not necessarily require repair"
		explanation "The correct answer is an absolute claim that's not true all the time. More code could be more clear, easier to read, with self-documenting variables. It could be the right length to do what it needs to do. Conciseness may lead to worse readability and less maintainability."
