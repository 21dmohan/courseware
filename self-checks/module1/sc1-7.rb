		text "Which statement about private data centers vs. public utility computing (such as AWS) is true?"
		answer "Private data centers may be the only option for apps subject to government regulation "
		distractor "Private data centers are not shared by multiple companies / competitors"
		distractor "Private data centers are inherently more secure than public utility computing"
		distractor "Private data centers could match the cost of public utility computing if they just used the same type of hardware and software"
		explanation "Private data centers are often shared by multiple customers, but they cannot match the cost of public utility computing simply because of how much fewer customers there are for private data centers. Often times, the staff and utility used for both public and private data centers are the same, so thereâ€™s nothing inherently more secure about a data center being private."
