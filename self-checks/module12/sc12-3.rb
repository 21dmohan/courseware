		text "RottenPotatoes’ target uptime is 99.9%. Yesterday there was a one hour outage. Which statement is true:"
		answer "There isn’t enough information to determine whether RottenPotatoes can meet its user-perceived uptime goal"
		distractor "Because of the outage, RottenPotatoes has no hope of meeting its uptime goal this year"
		distractor "RottenPotatoes can still meet its uptime goal if there are no further outages this year"
		distractor "If no live users actually tried to get to the site during the outage, uptime wasn’t hurt"
		explanation "Recall that Uptime is a measure of system reliability, expressed as the percentage of time a machine, typically a computer, has been working and available. Without knowing the time frame of the target uptime, there's no way for us to evaluate whether the percentage has been met."
